```

The first assignment is to write a lexical analyzer (lexer)
**You can build your entire lexer using a FSM, Or build using at least FSMs for identifier, integer and real (the rest can be written ad-hoc)**
but ***YOU HAVE TO CONSTRUCT A FSM for this assignment otherwise, there will be a deduction of 2 points!***

**Note: In your documentation (design section), YOU MUST write the REs for Identifiers, Real and Integer, and also show the NFSM using Thompson.**

### The Lexer

A major component of your assignment will be to write a procedure (Function) â€“ lexer (),  that returns a  token when it is needed.  Your lexer()  should return a record, one field for the token and another field the actual "value" of the token (lexeme), i.e. the instance of a token.

**Your main program should test the lexer i.e., your program should read a file containing the source code of Rat18F to generate tokens and write out the results to an output file.**

Make sure that you print both, the tokens and lexemes.

*Basically, your main program should work as follows:*
```txt
     while not finished (i.e. not end of the source file) do
          call the lexer for a token 
          print the token and lexeme
     endwhile
```

Do at least 3 test cases and make sure that you turn in proper documentation using the documentation template.

### A simple  test case

                   (Partial) Source code:
                                        while  (fahr < upper)   a = 23.00 whileend

                   Output:
                   token                              lexeme
                   keyword                            while
                   separator                          (
                   identifier                         fahr
                   operator                           <
                   identifier                         upper
                   separator                          )
                   identifier                         a
                   operator                           =
                   real                               23.00
                   keyword                            whileend
